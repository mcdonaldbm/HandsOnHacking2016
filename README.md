This is for my examples in the November 18 2016 talk at "Hands on Hacking" in Columbia, MO.

In this talk we cover what a basic function can do, as well as an advanced function and how that can add much needed features.

Lastly in the talk, we will cover ways to subvert Execution Policy in PowerShell, but the uploaded examples don't go into that.
